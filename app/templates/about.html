		This website is made to be a free and not for profit tool for miners of Waltonchain. The purpose is to allow people to monitor blocks they mine with regard to each seperate mining machine. It is run and maintaned by Walton fans as a way to contribute to the community, but is not our full time job. We are not professionals, and we do not store and will not ever ask for any users information such as private keys. If you want to help out you can reach us below or make a contribution on our GitHub. <br/>
	</b1>

	<b1>
		The website is currently running on a home server (personal computer), due to the Waltonchain mining program only being avaliable for Windows. Please forgive us if it is a bit slow to update to the latest blocks, migration to a better hosting service will happen as soon as possible. <br/>
	</b1>

	<b1>
		Please note that this website is in BETA. We are focusing on getting everything working behind the scenes before making it look pretty. If anyone has any ideas or would like to help out contact us below. <br/>
